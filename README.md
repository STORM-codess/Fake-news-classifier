Here‚Äôs a concise and professional project description for your **Fake News Classifier**:

---

### üîç Fake News Classifier with Explainable AI

The **Fake News Classifier** is a machine learning-based system designed to automatically detect misleading or false news articles. Built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms, the project focuses on distinguishing between **real** and **fake** news headlines or articles, specifically within the **Indian context**.

#### ‚úÖ Key Features:

* **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF vectorization for robust feature extraction.
* **Model Training:** Trained multiple classification models like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Naive Bayes**, achieving high accuracy on labeled datasets.
* **Explainability:** Integrated **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to provide interpretable model predictions ‚Äî users can understand which words influenced a fake or real prediction.
* **Dashboard & Insights:**

  * Visual display of fake news trends over time
  * Top indicative words for fake and real news
  * Model confidence visualization

#### üß† Tech Stack:

* **Python**, **scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **SHAP**, **Streamlit** (optional for dashboard)
* Dataset: Cleaned and balanced dataset containing labeled Indian news articles

#### üîç Use Cases:

* Helping readers and researchers detect misinformation
* Educational tool to demonstrate how AI can be used responsibly in combating fake news
* Basis for further extensions into multilingual or social media fake news detection
